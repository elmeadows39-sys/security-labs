# security-labs
This repository documents a segmented home network and homelab platform.

The environment is designed with a trusted home network and a separate lab network to safely support learning, experimentation, and resume-building projects. The lab is intentionally isolated to reduce risk to everyday devices while enabling hands-on work with infrastructure, security, and system design.

Over time, this project may include media services, experimental workloads, and security labs, all built on the same underlying network foundation.
